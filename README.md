# TetrisAI

Training a Neural Network to play Tetris using NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT). Runs in-browser using vanilla JS.

NEAT algorithm implemented by me based on [the paper](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) by Kenneth Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen.

Neural network recieves as input nodes the height of each column on the board and has three output nodes: move left, move right, or rotate.
